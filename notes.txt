I think the best way to extract information (for the team to process) is:

1) Rewrite the reader function to only extract the data we want (weekends and weekdays)
2) Iterate through the years and pull out only this data, and create a data structure of format:
	d = [
		{
		year1: [
			{activity: value}
			],...
		},
		{
		year2: ...
		}
	]
3) Iterate through the data structure somehow (still undecided) and rearrange data to fit the format:
	d = [
		{
		weekend: [
				{
				activity1: [
					[year1,value],
					[year2,value],...
				]
				}
			]
		}
		weekday: [...]
	]
4) Pass that new data structure to the browser. 
5) Write a .txt file that explains how to access this data structure
6) Upload to Github and send team link
