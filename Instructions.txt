I updated the data structure which contains all of the information for different activities from years 2006 - 2013.

The main structure is a dictionary with two keys: Weekend and Weekday
Each key has a value of an array of activities. 
The index of each activity is as follows (although you can always check the activity name in the array):

0: personal activities
1: health-related self-care
2: watching tv
3: animals and pets
4: travel related to household activities
5: food preparation
6: grocery shopping
7: financial services and banking
8: organizational, civic. and religious activities
9: religious and spiritual activities
10: educational activities
11: working and work-related activities
12: job search and interviewing
13: travel related to work

Each activity is of the format, [activity name, [data]]
For example, say we assign all of our data to the 'data' variable. If we want to get the string "Personal Activities" for the weekend, we would type in JavaScript: 

data.Weekend[0][0]

If we were to type data.Weekend[0][1], we would get an array of data about this particular activity, where values are percent engaged. I formatted it as follows:

[
	{"year":"2006", "percent":value},
	{"year":"2007", "percent":value},
	{"year":"2008", "percent":value},
	{"year":"2009", "percent":value},
	{"year":"2010", "percent":value},
	{"year":"2011", "percent":value},
	{"year":"2012", "percent":value},
	{"year":"2013", "percent":value}
]

This should make it easier to create charts from the data. If this dataset is called "d" by D3 (the default), then to get the x-value we would type d.year, and to get the y-value we would type d.percent


Note: Education data is formatted differently from the other activities.
It contains both percent engaged and hourly data, which means that instead of the format above, it instead looks like this:

[
	[
		{"year":"2006", "percent":value},
		{"year":"2007", "percent":value},
		{"year":"2008", "percent":value},
		{"year":"2009", "percent":value},
		{"year":"2010", "percent":value},
		{"year":"2011", "percent":value},
		{"year":"2012", "percent":value},
		{"year":"2013", "percent":value}
	],
	[
		{"year":"2006", "hours":value},
		{"year":"2007", "hours":value},
		{"year":"2008", "hours":value},
		{"year":"2009", "hours":value},
		{"year":"2010", "hours":value},
		{"year":"2011", "hours":value},
		{"year":"2012", "hours":value},
		{"year":"2013", "hours":value}
	]
]

In this case, data.Weekend[10][1][0] would return an array of percent engaged, and data.Weekend[10][1][1] would return an array of hours per weekend.


Hope this helps!
